General policy statement : Supplier engagement and procurement

ODI operates an open procurement process. This means we may publish data about work which we have contracted.

We reserve the right to publish information such as our supplier’s names, the cost of services we have purchased, and related service provision metrics. For example, with an IT contract we may make Service Level Agreement terms and the suppliers performance against them available as Open Data.

Suppliers (or those pitching to supply) will be assessed based on their

    - Quality of service

    - Price competitiveness

    - Commitment to Open Data, its culture and community

    - Environmental policies

    - Social policies

    - Communications expertise

Where relevant, open data relating to service provision must be supplied.

ODI’s definition of Open Data is data that is;

1. Structured (in a machine-readable, logical format)

2. Addressable (via a URL/URI)

3. Traceable (the provenance of the data is documented) and Licensed (e.g. BY-SA)

4. Continuous (as in continuity of supply)

Providers should provide relevant information as open data as part of their contract. The ODI reserves the right to re-publish such information as open data. The purpose of this is to help secure the most effective services and to maintain quality of service. One supplier benefit is that those providing the best services will gain the greatest positive exposure.

We expect at least the following information to be supplied as Open Data:

1) Contract information

Financial terms, key dates (for example renewal dates, key deliverable dates), and service level agreement terms.

2) Performance data

Where relevant, the service level and performance metrics against which the service will be monitored and assessed, and the actual performance data against those metrics.

3) Data assets

Any and all relevant data assets howsoever created under contract with the supplier must be made available in a timely manner under an open license.
